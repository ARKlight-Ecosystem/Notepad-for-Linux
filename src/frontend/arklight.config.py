ARKlight project configuration -- optional.

ARKlight works fine without this file; every section below is
commented out and only takes effect once you uncomment it. Full
reference: `arklight/config.py` in the ARKlight source (there is no
separate "Configuration" section in the README).

This file must be named exactly `arklight.config.py` and sit next to
`site.py` -- it is not searched for in parent directories, and other
names (`config.py`, `config.js`, `arklight.config.json`) are ignored.
Section and key names must match exactly: an unrecognized one prints a
build-time warning ("did you mean ...?") rather than silently doing
nothing, but is never rejected outright.
